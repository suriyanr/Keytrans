KeyTransU (for WINDOWS OS)
=======

Facilities:
---------

	1. This is a keyboard driver with maximum possible baskets in a keyboard.
These are: a) Normal, b) Shift, c) Ctrl+Alt, and d) Ctrl+Alt+Shift.
	2. Language and layout are changable to suit the knowledgable end user, who can edit the map file, in Notepad.
	3. This has all types of ligature features.
	4. This facilitates BMP Unicode character typing.
	5. It is suitable for Windows2000, WindowsXP and WindowsVista.	

	Limitation:
	 	Unless the concerned language is enabled in the System, (this requires the Install CD) via controlpanel --> RegionalLanguages etc, (apllies to 2K & XP), this driver works in WordPad, Outlook, OutlookExpress, FrontPage, Internet Explorer, MS's Word and in other MS's Office suite. If enabled, together with the above, it works in NotePad text files too.

	Those of you not able to do the above enabling, can still use it in NotePad, after opening the txt file with WordPad (RTF).


	It is ready for:
		This driver comes ready for use with Tamil.

	Presently, Tamil has three methods (styles) of keyboard input:
	1. English Phonetic (Transliteration),
	2. MS's (Default) Tamil Phonetic, and,
 	3. Tamil Grammatic (TamilNet99).

	All these three methods (styles) avoid facing a serious handicap created by  Unicode. (More on this at: www.geocities.com/vee_ramasami)

	The (new) 4th, VUTAM Type_As_You_Write method, however, faces this problem and hence facilitates one to type Tamil, the way Tamils write Tamil on paper.

	Necessary map files for all four methods, are also part of this package. End user can choose the method most suitable for him. The default is the VUTAM method.

	A free Unicode Tamil font file, UTAM.ttf, is also available for immediate use of the package.

	VUTAM Layout:
		 The 'a' vowel marked consonants, the 'u' vowel marked consonants and the 'U' vowel marked consonants are accomodated in the first three baskets. The fourth has English small letters, for occasional use.

	Other Layouts:
		 First two baskets accomodate Tamil and the rest, English.
	
	Installation:
	(A)	Download/save vutam3.exe and then double click Vutam3.exe. It will: i) install the KeyTransU.exe in Program Files folder, and ii) create shortcut "Vutam3" in Desktop. On Vista, it might have to be run with higher privileges.
	OR
	(B)	Open Vutam3.exe from Sarovar; it will install KeyTransU in the Program Files Folder of your machine etc.

	To install UTAM.ttf:

		In Vista right click the UTAM font file in Program Files folder and choose Install. In all other Windows versions you will have to manually install the UTAM font from Control Panel -> Fonts.

		Now you are all set.

	Enable / Disable:
		Keyboard method:
		Pressing Alt-0 will disable the translation.
		Pressing Alt-1 will enable the translation.
		Mouse method:
		Click on the Keyboard icon on the tray bar. Choose Disable to disable the translation. Choose Enable to enable the translation.

	USE:
	First open the file in which you want to type Tamil. "file" here means OE, IE etc too. Then click & execute Vutam3 DeskTop shortcut. A small keyboard icon appears in the system tray (right hand bottom of screen). Start typing.

	You may enable/ disable/ change style of typing/ exit etc by right clicking the tray icon and clicking the required choice.

	To uninstall:
		 Delete the shortcut from Desktop and the folder KeyTransU from the Program Files folder.
